 New Project Alert! 💻✨

 
I decided to combine my passion for coding with my favorite anime character, Roronoa Zoro.
I just launched my new portfolio website featuring a "Deep, Dark, and Sharp" aesthetic. I moved away from standard templates to create something unique using React and Tailwind CSS.
🎨 Theme: Charcoal Black & Vibrant Teal (inspired by Zoro’s aura).
⚡ Tech: React.js, Tailwind, ES6+.
📱 Design: Fully responsive and sharp.
Check out the live link below and let me know what you think of the design!
